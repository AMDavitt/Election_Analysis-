# Election-Audit Summary
* This script could be modified in many ways to analyze future elections. Depending on the granularity of the source data, vote breakdown could be viewed on city district or neighborhood level to see how different regions within a county voted. The script could also be modified by using different list inputs to view results based on different demographics (income level, age groups, race, etc.) these demographic breakdowns could then be viewed with very minor modifications to the final script used in this challenge.
